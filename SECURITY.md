# Security Guide

This document outlines security considerations for the OneNote to Markdown Exporter.

## üîí Sensitive Data Handling

### What's Been Secured

‚úÖ **Client ID**: Removed hardcoded client ID from all files
‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Added support for `ONENOTE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable
‚úÖ **Configuration**: Created `config_example.py` for safe configuration examples
‚úÖ **Gitignore**: Excluded sensitive files and directories

### Files to Review Before Publishing

1. **Check for any remaining hardcoded credentials**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "34eaf836-3a99-43f6-8b51-e127d16c7bb2" .
   ```

2. **Verify .gitignore excludes sensitive data**:
   - `output/` - Contains exported OneNote data
   - `*.log` - May contain sensitive information
   - `config.py` - User-specific configuration
   - `.env` - Environment variables

3. **Review exported content**:
   - Check `output/` directory for any personal/sensitive information
   - Remove or anonymize any personal data before publishing

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export ONENOTE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-here"
   ```

2. **Never commit credentials**:
   - Don't add `config.py` with real credentials
   - Don't commit `.env` files
   - Don't hardcode client IDs in scripts

3. **Review exported data**:
   - Check `output/` directory before sharing
   - Remove any sensitive personal information

### For Contributors

1. **Test with dummy data**:
   - Use test notebooks for development
   - Don't commit real exported content

2. **Follow security guidelines**:
   - Always use environment variables for secrets
   - Don't log sensitive information
   - Handle errors without exposing internal details
